# Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using the Telco Customer Churn dataset. The objective is to analyze customer behavior, identify churn patterns, and build machine learning models that can accurately predict whether a customer is likely to discontinue the service. The entire workflow, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation, is implemented in the Jupyter Notebook included in this repository.

The project follows a complete machine learning pipeline involving data loading, cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, visualizing feature distributions, training multiple models, and comparing their performance. Models used include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices are used to assess performance and select the best model for churn prediction.

The dataset used is the Telco Customer Churn dataset, which contains information about customer demographics, subscription details, service usage, billing patterns, and payment methods. These features help in understanding which factors influence customer churn and how they contribute to the model’s predictive ability.

To run the project, clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/moazam10/customer-churn-prediction.git`, install the necessary dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and open the notebook using `jupyter notebook`. The main file, `churn prediction.ipynb`, contains all steps from data preprocessing to final model evaluation.

This project aims to demonstrate how machine learning can help businesses identify customers at risk of leaving, enabling proactive retention strategies and better decision-making.
